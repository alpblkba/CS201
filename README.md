data structure related codes

HW2 may have some imperfections. 

HW5 may have some crashes whilst opening it, because some names have been changed during the arrangement of files. 
It is just for seeing the class hierarchy and the data structure. 

Homework 5.docx is the main case. It's for drawing a comparison between the algorithms (in terms of efficiency, speed etc.) that I have implemented in HW1-3-4.
